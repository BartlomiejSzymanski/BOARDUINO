# BOARDUINO
A team project prepared for PZSP1 (Team Project 1) subject while attending Warsaw University of Technology.

Short Overview:
The final outcome of our team effort came to be a working prototype of a board game helping device. 
It's main objective is to read field number input from the player and return with a story unit, chosen
from a greater pool of short tales. The idea is to enhance playing experience by adding a story line
to a well known game of Monopoly. In this particular case, we took on to let the players join a mafia
in a quest to estabilish their position. Only the toughest last.
